                        software Java-DSP and its award winning iPhone/iPad and Android versions.
                        He is author of two text books: Audio Processing and Coding by Wiley and
                        DSP; An Interactive Approach (2nd Ed.). He contributed to more than 300
                        papers, 7 monographs 8 full patents and 10 patent pre-disclosures. He
                        served as Associate Editor of the IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing
                        and as General Co-chair of IEEE ICASSP-99. He also served as the IEEE
                        Signal Processing Vice-President for Conferences. Andreas Spanias is
                        co-recipient of the 2002 IEEE Donald G. Fink paper prize award and was
                        elected Fellow of the IEEE in 2003. He served as Distinguished lecturer for
                        the IEEE Signal processing society in 2004. He is a series editor for the
                        Morgan and Claypool lecture series on algorithms and software. He received
                        recently the 2018 IEEE Phoenix Chapter award from the IEEE Section 6
                        Director. "For significant innovations and patents in signal processing for
                        sensor systems." More info at:
