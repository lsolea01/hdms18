    ------------------------------------------

The Hellenic Data Management Symposium (HDMS) is the annual
forum for the Greek database community to present and
discuss recent advances in the data management field.
The 16th HDMS will be held between July 2-4, 2018 at the
Golden Bay Beach Hotel in Larnaca, Cyprus
(https://goldenbay.com.cy/) with a half-day session at the
New Campus of the University of Cyprus in Nicosia, Cyprus
(https://www.ucy.ac.cy/).

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
* Core database technologies (e.g., query processing and
  optimization, storage and indexing, database concurrency
  control, OLTP and OLAP processing).
* Non-traditional data management architectures (e.g., data
  stream management, cloud data management, peer-to-peer
  systems, mobile data management, blockchain databases).
* Data management applications (e.g., geographical
  information systems, data warehouses, social networks,
  scientific databases, IoT, crowd sourcing).
* Models and languages for the management of data (e.g., XML,
  RDF, probabilistic databases, meta-data management,
  multi-media, graph data management).
* Techniques for high performance and scalability in the
  management of  data (e.g., distributed data processing,
  hardware accelerators, new hardware technologies).
* Confluence of data management with: information retrieval,
  knowledge management, natural language processing, and data
  mining.
* Other aspects of modern information systems (e.g.,
  security, privacy, user interfaces, energy use
  minimization).

HDMS 2018 will feature the following tracks:
